PlayMe
======
PlayMe is a simple and elegant utility for getting more from your music.  It remains in your menubar and gives just the information you want, when you want it.

About
=====
I designed PlayMe from scratch because it was something I wanted, and because I wanted ot teach msyelf Objective C.  I am offering the application free of charge and it is currenlty operational under OSX 10.8-10.9.  I am testing it under OSX 10.10 right now, but still working out some subtle bugs.
